# What is gVirtualXray

# A practical introduction to gVirtualXray in Python

# Session 2

# Session 3



- Introduction
- How does gVirtualXray simulate X-ray images
- Warming up (01-import_gvxr.ipynb)
- First X-ray simulation (02-first_xray_simulation.ipynb)
- Same but using a JSON file (03-setting_a_simulation_using_a_JSON_file.ipynb)


# Warming up

People log in, load Jupyter, import the package and check its version
